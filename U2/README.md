*This was a program for a company that has arcades for all ages and wants to automatically calculate the price it will charge its customers to enter. The program should ask the user for the customer's age and display the price of the ticket. If the client is under 4 years old, they can enter for free, if they are between 4 and 18 years old they must pay $5 and if they are over 18 years old, $10.*
